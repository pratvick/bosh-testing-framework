# Asynchronous JavaScript with deferred and promises

Promises in a simple and powerful way. It was built with the _less is more_ mantra in mind. It's just few functions that should give all you need to easily configure complicated asynchronous control flow.

This work is inspired by other deferred/promise implementations, in particular [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) by [Kris Kowal](https://github.com/kriskowal).

<a name="example" />
## Example

Concat all JavaScript files in a given directory and save it to lib.js.

Plain Node.js:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')

  , readdir = fs.readdir
  , readFile = fs.readFile
  , writeFile = fs.writeFile

// Read all filenames in given path
readdir(__dirname, function (err, files) {
	var result, waiting;
	if (err) {
		// if we're unable to get file listing throw error
		throw err;
	}

	// Filter *.js files
	files = files.filter(function (file) {
		return (file.slice(-3) === '.js') && (file !== 'lib.js');
	});

	// Read content of each file
	waiting = 0;
	result = [];
	files.forEach(function (file, index) {
		++waiting;
		readFile(file, 'utf8', function (err, content) {
			if (err) {
				// We were not able to read file content, throw error
				throw err;
			}
			result[index] = content;

			if (!--waiting) {
				// Got content of all files
				// Concatenate into one string and write into lib.js
				writeFile(__dirname + '/lib.js', result.join("\n"), function (err) {
					if (err) {
						// We cannot write lib.js file, throw error
						throw err;
					}
				});
			}
		});
	});
});
```

Promises approach:

```javascript
var deferred = require('deferred')
  , fs = require('fs')

// We prepare promisified versions of each asynchronous function
  , readdir = deferred.promisify(fs.readdir)
  , readFile = deferred.promisify(fs.readFile)
  , writeFile = deferred.promisify(fs.writeFile);

writeFile(__dirname + '/lib.js',
	// Read all filenames in given path
	readdir(__dirname)

	// Filter *.js files
	.invoke('filter', function (file) {
		return (file.slice(-3) === '.js') && (file !== 'lib.js');
	})

	// Read content of all files
	.map(function (file) {
		return readFile(file, 'utf-8');
	})

	// Concatenate files content into one string
	.invoke('join', '\n')

).end(); // If there was eny error on the way throw it

<a name="installation" />
## Installation

<a name="installation-nodejs" />
### Node.js

In your project path:

	$ npm install deferred

<a name="installation-browser" />
### Browser

You can easily create browser bundle with help of [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake). Mind that it relies on EcmaScript5 features, so for older browsers you need as well [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim)

<a name="concept" />
## Deferred/Promise concept

<a name="concept-deferred" />
### Deferred

For work that doesn't return immediately (asynchronous) you may create deferred object. Deferred holds both `resolve` and `promise` objects. Observers interested in value are attached to `promise` object, with `resolve` we resolve promise with an actual value. In common usage `promise` is returned to the world and `resolve` is kept internally

Let's create `delay` function decorator. Decorates function so its execution is delayed in time:

```javascript
var deferred = require('deferred');

var delay = function (fn, timeout) {
	return function () {
		var d = deferred(), self = this, args = arguments;

		setTimeout(function () {
			d.resolve(fn.apply(self, args));
		}, timeout);

		return d.promise;
	};
};

var delayedAdd = delay(function (a, b) {
	return a + b;
}, 100);

var resultPromise = delayedAdd(2, 3);

console.log(deferred.isPromise(resultPromise)); // true

resultPromise(function (value) {
	// Invoked after 100 milliseconds
	console.log(value); // 5
});
```

<a name="concept-promise" />
### Promise

Promise is an object that represents eventual value which may already be available or is expected to be available in a future. Promise may succeed (fulfillment) or fail (rejection). Promise can be resolved only once.  
In `deferred` (and most of the other promise implementations) you may listen for the value by passing observers to `then` function:

```javascript
promise.then(onsuccess, onfail);
```

In __deferred__ promise is really a `then` function, so you may use promise _function_ directly:

```javascript
promise === promise.then; // true
promise(onsuccess, onfail)
```

__However if you want to keep clear visible distinction between promises and other object I encourage you to always use `promise.then` notation.__

Both callbacks `onsuccess` and `onfail` are optional. They will be called only once aand only either `onsuccess` or `onfail` will be called.

<a name="concept-promise-chaining" />
#### Chaining

Promises by nature can be chained. `promise` function returns another promise which is resolved with a value returned by a callback function:

```javascript
delayedAdd(2, 3)
(function (result) {
	return result*result
})
(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // 25
});
```

It's not just function arguments that promise function can take, it can be other promises or any other JavaScript value (however `null` or `undefined` will be treated as no value). With such approach you may override result of a promise chain with specific value. It may seem awkward approach at first, but it can be handy when you work with sophisticated promises chains.

<a name="concept-promise-nesting" />
#### Nesting

Promises can be nested. If a promise resolves with another promise, it's not really resolved. It's resolved only when final promise is resolved with a real value:

```javascript
var d = deferred();
d.resolve(delayedAdd(2, 3));
d.promise(function (result) {
	console.log(5); // 5;
});
```

<a name="concept-promise-errorhandling" />
#### Error handling

Errors in promises are handled with separate control flow, that's one of the reasons why code written with promises is more readable and maintanable than when using callbacks approach.

A promise resolved with an error (rejected), propagates its error to all promises that depend on this promise (e.g. promises initiated by adding observers).  
If observer function crashes with error or returns error, its promise is rejected with the error.

To handle error, pass dedicated callback as second argument to promise function:

```javascript
delayedAdd(2, 3)
(function (result) {
	throw new Error('Error!')
})
(function () {
	// never called
}, function (e) {
	// handle error;
});
```

<a name="concept-promise-end" />
#### Ending chain

When there is no error callback passed, eventual error is silent. To expose the error, end promise chain with `.end()`, then error that broke the chain will be thrown:

```javascript
delayedAdd(2, 3)
(function (result) {
	throw new Error('Error!')
})
(function (result) {
	// never executed
})
.end(); // throws error!
```

__It's very important to end your promise chains with `end` otherwise eventual errors that were not handled will not be exposed__.  
`end` is an exit from promises flow. You can call it with one callback argument and it will be called same way as callback passed to Node.js style asynchronous function:

```javascript
promise(function (value) {
	// process
}).end(function (err, result) {
	if (err) {
		// handle error
		return;
	}
	// process result
});
```

Altenatively you can pass two callbacks _onsuccess_ and _onerror_ and that will resemble way `.then` works, with difference that it won't extend chain with another promise:

```javascript
promise(function (value) {
	// process
}).end(function (result) {
	// process result
}, function (err) {
	// handle error
});
```

Just _onerror_ may be provided:

```javascript
promise(function (value) {
	// process
}).end(null, function (err) {
	// handle error
});
```

<a name="concept-promise-creatingresolved" />
#### Creating resolved promises

With `deferred` function you may create initially resolved promises.

```javascript
var promise = deferred(1);

promise(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // 1;
});
```

<a name="promisify" />
## Promisify - working with asynchronous functions as we know it from Node.js

There is a known convention (coined by Node.js) for working with asynchronous calls. The following approach is widely used:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, 'utf-8', function (err, content) {
	if (err) {
		// handle error;
		return;
	}
	// process content
});
```

An asynchronous function receives a callback argument which handles both error and expected value.  
It's not convienient to work with both promises and callback style functions. When you decide to build your flow with promises __don't mix both concepts, just `promisify` asynchronous functions so they return promises instead__.

```javascript
var deferred = require('deferred')
	, fs = require('fs')

	, readFile = deferred.promisify(fs.readFile);

	readFile(__filename, 'utf-8')
	(function (content) {
		// process content
	}, function (err) {
		// handle error
	});
```

With second argument passed to `promisify` we may specify length of arguments that function takes before callback argument. It's very handy if we want to work with functions that may call our function with unexpected arguments (e.g. Array's `forEach` or `map`)

`promisify` also takes care of input arguments. __It makes sure that all arguments that are to be passed to asynchronous function are first resolved.__

<a name="grouping" />
## Grouping promises

Sometimes we're interested in results of more than one promise object. We may do it again with help `deferred` function:

```javascript
deferred(delayedAdd(2, 3), delayedAdd(3, 5), delayedAdd(1, 7))
(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // [5, 8, 8]
});
```

<a name="collections" />
## Processing collections

<a name="collections-map" />
### Map

It's analogous to Array's map, with that difference that it returns promise (of an array) that would be resolved when promises for all items are resolved. Any error that would occur will reject the promise and resolve it with same error.

Let's say we have list of filenames and we want to get each file's content:

```javascript
var readFile = deferred.promisify(fs.readFile);

deferred.map(filenames, function (filename) {
	return readFile(filename, 'utf-8');
})
(function (result) {
	// result is an array of file's contents
});
```

`map` is also available directly on a promise object, so we may invoke it directly on promise of a collection.

Let's try again previous example but this time instead of relying on already existing filenames, we take list of files from current directory:

```javascript
var readdir = deferred.promisify(fs.readdir)
	, readFile = deferred.promisify(fs.readFile);

readdir(__dirname).map(function (filename) {
	return readFile(filename, 'utf-8');
})
(function (result) {
	// result is an array of file's contents
});
```

<a name="collections-reduce" />
### Reduce

It's same as Array's reduce with that difference that it calls callback only after previous accummulated value is resolved, this way we may accumulate results of collection of promises or invoke some asynchronous tasks one after another.

```javascript
deferred.reduce([delayedAdd(2, 3), delayedAdd(3, 5), delayedAdd(1, 7)], function (a, b) {
	return delayedAdd(a, b);
})
(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // 21
});
```

As with `map`, `reduce` is also available directly as an extension on promise object.

<a name="extensions" />
## Promise extensions

Promise objects are equipped with some useful extensions. All extension are optional but are loaded by default when `deferred` is loaded via `require('deferred')` import, and that's the recommended way when you work with Node.js.
When preparing client-side file (with help of e.g. [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake)) you are free to decide, which extensions you want to take (see source of `lib/index.js` on how to do it)

<a name="extensions-get" />
### get

If you're interested not in promised object, but rather in one of it's properties then use `get`

```javascript
var promise = deferred({ foo: 'bar' });

promise(function (obj) {
	console.log(obj.foo); // 'bar';
})

promise.get('foo')(function (value) {
	console.log(value); // 'bar'
});
```

<a name="extensions-invoke" />
### invoke

Schedule function call on promised object

```javascript
var promise = deferred({ foo: function (arg) { return arg*arg; } });

promise.invoke('foo', 3)
(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // 9
});

// It works also with asynchronous functions
var promise = deferred({ foo: function (arg, callback) {
	setTimeout(function () {
		callback(null, arg*arg);
	}, 100);
} });

promise.invoke('foo', 3)
(function (result) {
	console.log(result); // 9
});
```

<a name="extensions-map" />
### map

As described in [Processing collections](#collections-map) section it's promise aware version of Array's map

<a name="extensions-match" />
### match

If promise expected value is a list that you want to match into function arguments then use `match`

```javascript
var promise = deferred([2, 3]);

promise.match(function (a, b) {
	console.log(a + b); // 5
});
```

<a name="extensions-reduce" />
### reduce

Described under [Processing collections](#collections-reduce) section. Promise aware version of Array's reduce
